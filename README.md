# CLI Tool for Code Packaging

## Introduction

A Command Line Interface (CLI), often abbreviated as CLI, is a small software that allows you to execute its functionality by running a command through a command-line interface.
The tool you will develop will package code files into a single file. It will simply copy the code from the files and paste it into the packaging file.
The packaging operation will be activated by a special command that will also define exactly how the packaging will be done.

## Features

- Package multiple code files into a single file.
- Define packaging rules and configurations.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.
